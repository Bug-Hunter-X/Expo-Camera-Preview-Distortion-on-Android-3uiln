This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific aspect ratios.  The preview image displayed in the app may be distorted or incorrectly sized, particularly on certain Android devices. This distortion does not necessarily affect the final image captured, only what is shown in the preview. The issue seems to be related to how the Camera component handles aspect ratio calculations and screen orientations, and is exacerbated by differing screen densities across various Android devices.
